I'm happy to share that OpenBao will be present at two conferences in February: FOSDEM '25 in Brussels and State of Open Con 2025 in London!

<!-- truncate -->

### FOSDEM

I will be [giving a talk](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5145-openbao-at-gitlab-building-native-secrets-for-gitlab-ci-cd-pipelines/) on Sunday, February 2nd, at 2:05 PM GMT+1 in [room UA2.118 (Henriot)](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/room/ua2118/) as part of the [Identity and Access Management](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/iam/) track. I'll give a brief history of the project, share how GitLab is using OpenBao, and ways you can become involved. Several OpenBao maintainers will be there, including Jan Martens, and stickers will be available!

This talk will also be [live-streamed](https://live.fosdem.org/watch/ua2118) for anyone unable to make it.

### State of Open Con

Thanks to the generous help of [Amanda Brock](https://openuk.uk/profiles/amanda-brock/) and [Dotan Horovits](https://github.com/horovits/), OpenBao has been provided a free non-profit table at [State of Open Con](https://stateofopencon.com/) from Tuesday, February 4th to Wednesday, February 5th. If you're curious about OpenBao and want to try some hands-on demos, stop by the booth--plenty of stickers will be available and we'll be contributing an OpenBao mascot (like pictured above) to the prize drawing on Tuesday!

If any community members are interested in helping to staff the booth, let us know as we have one free registration remaining.
