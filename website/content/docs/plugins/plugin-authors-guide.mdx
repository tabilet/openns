## List pagination

When implementing listing, it is recommended to use pagination so that items are 
processed in increments rather than loading the entire set into memory at once. 
Learn more in [rfcs/paginated-lists](https://openbao.org/docs/rfcs/paginated-lists/). 
`HandleListPage(...)` is a helper introduced in [PR #781](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/781) 
to streamline list pagination across implementations. It supports both item-level 
and batch-level callbacks for flexibility:

- **`itemCallback(...)`**: Processes individual entries within a page.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `page` (int): The index of the current page.
     - `index` (int): The index of the entry within the current page.
     - `entry` (*logical.StorageEntry): The current storage entry being processed.
   - **Returns**:
     - `cont` (bool): Whether to continue processing further entries.
     - `err` (error): An error, if encountered.

- **`batchCallback(...)`**: Executes after processing all entries in a page.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `page` (int): The index of the current page.
     - `entries` ([]*logical.StorageEntry): All entries in the current batch.
   - **Returns**:
     - `cont` (bool): Whether to continue processing further pages.
     - `err` (error): An error, if encountered.

The callbacks are executed sequentially, with `itemCallback` processing each entry individually,
followed by `batchCallback` handling the entire batch.
